# SortingAlgorithm
 
This algorithm sorts 10 totally random numbers.
It loops through the entire list of number 100 times. When a number is larger than the number after that one it switches places with those two.
Example:
''' python
if Sort[y] > Sort[y+1]:
    Memory = Sort[y]
    Sort[y] = Sort[y+1]
    Sort[y+1] = Memory
'''
variable y is the current number
y+1 is the next number
